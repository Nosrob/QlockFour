# QlockFour
The LEDs in my QlockThree died. Time to build a new one.

I used RGBW leds for this one, so I programmed several colorful modes:

* Default mode: Time is displayed with the white LED 
* Seconds mode: Seconds are displayed is large numbers on the front cover
* Colorcycle mode: Time is displayed using the RGB LEDs, one color at a time and cycling through the whole spectrum
* Rainbow mode: Time is displayed using the RGB LEDs, each letter having a different color and spanning across the whole spectrum
* Rainbow mode 2: Time is displayed using the RGB LEDs, each column having a different color and spanning across the whole spectrum
